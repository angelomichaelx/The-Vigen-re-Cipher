## The Vigenère Cipher

Vigenère cipher, type of substitution cipher used for data encryption in which the original plaintext structure is somewhat concealed in the ciphertextby using several different monoalphabetic substitution ciphers rather than just one; the code key specifies which particular substitution is to be employed for encrypting each plaintext symbol. Such resulting ciphers, known generically as polyalphabetics, have a long history of usage.
